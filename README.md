+ Project summary: In this project, we created an OCR post-processing procedure to enhance Tesseract OCR output in two steps. We split the text files by group and for each group, as a first step, classify each word using Cross-validated Support Vector Machines as erroneous and correct. Secondly we perform error correction using probability scoring on the erroneous tokens.
